Chat transcript (July 6, 2:11 PM): "Hi, I ordered a standing fan (Order #78945) on July 1st. It was supposed to come on July 3. Still no delivery. I paid for next-day delivery. Can someone tell me what’s going on?"



Follow-up Email 1 (July 9, 10:32 AM): "Still waiting. I called your helpline, was kept on hold for 26 mins and then cut off. No one got back to me. This is not acceptable. I’ve paid ₹340 for express and now it’s the 9th. My entire week’s schedule is ruined."



Follow-up Chat (July 11, 6:05 PM): "Your agent yesterday told me the fan had been shipped. Today I got a message saying it was delivered at 2 PM. NOTHING was delivered. I was home all day. No call, no knock. This is fake delivery."



Email escalation (July 13, 8:15 AM): "Now I’m told the delivery guy left it with ‘security.’ I live in an independent house. There IS no security! You’re just making excuses. Worst customer service I’ve ever seen. Tired of explaining again and again."



Final Email (July 16, 4:52 PM): "The fan finally arrived — box looks like it was in a warzone. Fan makes weird noises and stops after 2 minutes. I give up. Return it and refund EVERYTHING. I’m done. Absolutely ridiculous process. I’m never ordering again."]









\## Subject: Regarding Escalation Ticket #452017 - Order #78945 - S. Ramesh



Dear Mr. Ramesh,



Please accept our sincerest apologies for the unacceptable series of issues you have experienced with order #78945, placed on July 1st, 2025. We understand this has been a deeply frustrating and disappointing experience, and we take full responsibility for failing to meet your expectations.



We recognize that you have encountered multiple problems, starting with the delayed delivery of your standing fan, despite paying for express delivery. This was compounded by poor communication and extended wait times when you contacted our helpline. Furthermore, the false delivery claim on July 11th, followed by inaccurate information about the delivery location, caused significant distrust and further complicated the situation. Finally, the damaged condition of the product upon arrival and its malfunction only added to your dissatisfaction. We understand your frustration and disappointment with the entire process.



Here's a summary of the incidents:



| Date       | Incident                                         |

|------------|--------------------------------------------------|

| July 3rd   | Initial scheduled delivery date - Order not received |

| July 6th   | Customer inquired about the delayed delivery      |

| July 9th   | Customer follow-up regarding continued delay and poor helpline experience |

| July 11th  | False delivery claim - product not delivered    |

| July 13th  | Customer complaint regarding misleading delivery information |

| July 16th  | Damaged product finally delivered and malfunctioning|



To rectify this situation and regain your trust, we propose the following resolution plan:



1\.  \*\*Full Refund:\*\* We have already initiated a full refund for the purchase price of the standing fan, including the express delivery fee of ₹340. This should reflect in your account within 5-7 business days.

2\.  \*\*Return Shipping:\*\* We will arrange for the damaged fan to be picked up from your address at your convenience, free of charge. Please let us know what day works best for you.

3\.  \*\*Service Recovery Voucher:\*\* As a gesture of our sincere apology for the inconvenience caused, we would like to offer you a voucher worth ₹500, which can be used on any future purchase with us. We hope you will consider giving us another opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to providing excellent service.

4\.  \*\*Internal Review:\*\* We are conducting a thorough internal review of this incident to identify the root causes of the failures in our delivery and communication processes. This will help us prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.



We value your business and are truly sorry for the negative experience you've had. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you have any further questions or concerns.



Sincerely,
