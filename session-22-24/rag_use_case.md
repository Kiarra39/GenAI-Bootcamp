# RAG Use Case — Research Paper Summarization Tool

## 1. Problem / Knowledge Gap

Learners and researchers often struggle to find concise and relevant summaries of academic research on specific topics. Searching manually across multiple sources (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) is time-consuming and unstructured.

---

## 2. External Data Source

The tool retrieves data from **Semantic Scholar’s API** (or a simulated version in this prototype).  
This database provides access to millions of scientific papers and abstracts across multiple domains.

---

## 3. Type of Data

- Research paper titles  
- Abstracts  
- Author names  
- Publication year  
- Summary text (generated by the tool)

---

## 4. RAG Flow (Step-by-step)

1. **User Query:** User asks about a specific research topic.  
2. **Retriever:** The system fetches relevant papers from Semantic Scholar API based on keywords.  
3. **Augmentation:** Extracted abstracts are summarized and fed into the LLM as additional context.  
4. **Generation:** The LLM generates a concise and informed answer with citations or references.  
5. **Response Delivery:** The summarized output is displayed to the user.

---

## 5. Integration with Tool

- The `fetchResearchSummary()` function acts as the **retriever tool**.  
- It connects to the external API (or mock data) and gathers topic-based research insights.  
- The **RAG pipeline** uses this fetched data to enrich the LLM’s responses.

---

## 6. Future Scope

- Integrate real APIs (Semantic Scholar, PubMed, etc.)  
- Implement automatic citation extraction  
- Use embeddings for semantic similarity search  
- Enable dynamic knowledge base updates for recent papers  
- Integrate with the agent system for live RAG demonstrations# RAG Use Case — Research Paper Summarization Tool
