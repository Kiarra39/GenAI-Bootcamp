# 🧠 MindMapAI – AI-Powered Visual Knowledge Mapper

**MindMapAI** is an intelligent MERN-based study and productivity platform that helps learners, researchers, and professionals organize and understand complex information visually.  
It combines **AI-driven summarization**, **interactive mind mapping**, and a **task scheduler** into one seamless workspace.

---

## 🚀 Overview

MindMapAI transforms your notes into **AI-generated summaries** and **concept maps**, enabling structured learning and better retention.  
Each note can be **summarized by AI**, **visualized as a mind map**, and **linked to related concepts**, while the **task manager** helps you plan study sessions effectively.

> “Turn your notes into knowledge — powered by AI.”

## ⚙️ How It Works

### **1. Frontend (React.js)**
- Built with **React + Axios + React Router**.
- Components: Dashboard, FolderList, NoteEditor, MindMap, and TaskManager.
- Communicates securely with backend APIs using JWT authentication.

### **2. Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**
- Handles authentication, folders, notes, summaries, nodes, and tasks.
- Integrates **Google Gemini AI** for note summarization and node generation.
- All routes are protected with JWT middleware.

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | Register a new user |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Login user and return token |
| `/api/folders` | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | Manage user folders |
| `/api/notes` | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | CRUD operations for notes |
| `/api/ai/summary` | POST | Generate AI summary for a note |
| `/api/nodes` | POST | Generate and store concept nodes using AI |
| `/api/tasks` | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | Manage scheduled tasks |

## 🧠 AI Layer – Google Gemini API

MindMapAI integrates **Google Gemini AI** to intelligently process and understand your note content.  
It performs **summarization**, **concept extraction**, and **relationship mapping**, turning your written notes into interactive visual mind maps.

# 🚀 AI-Powered Features

### 🤖 AI Summarization
Condenses long notes into short, readable summaries.

### 🧩 Node Generation
Extracts key ideas and relationships for mind map visualization.

### 🌐 Context Expansion *(Future Feature)*
Fetches related data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### 🧠 Smart Learning Tools
Upcoming quiz and flashcard generation for better retention.
